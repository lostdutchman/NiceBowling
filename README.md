Since I'm not working on this project and have not worked on it in several years, I'm opening the game's source code and inviting any fools on the internet who dare try and make a better version to knock themselves out. We need more games that make kids cry. If you do something with my game, let me know and I'll play it. I'll also link it here.


*   [Nice Bowling Source Code](https://github.com/lostdutchman/nicebowling)
*   [Buy RetroAesthetics from dustyroom.com](https://dustyroom.com/)
*   [Ball Pack 1.0 by YounGen Tech](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/ball-pack-446)

That code is old and gross, so good luck. Also RetroAesthetics, which is like 90% of the vibes in this game, is not mine; you will need to pay for it if you plan to use it. There are also assets that will require attribution, YounGen Tec's Ball Pack, and if you use the music see below:

    *   Chill Wave
    *   Danger Storm
    *   Spellbound
    *   Voice Over Under
*   [Stevia Sphere](http://steviasphere.bandcamp.com/)
    *   glaciaere - Tundra
    *   Paternoster Poetry - Elevator Zen Again
